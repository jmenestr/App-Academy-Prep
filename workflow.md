# Workflow

### Step 1: Do the Readings
* Read the day's readings before starting the assignment. Instructions
  for the day's exercises may not be available ahead of time; but
  if they are, you should read those too.

### Step 2: Complete the Exercises
Work through the exercises and projects in the order presented. Don't
worry if the material is difficult or you get stuck--looking things up
is a necessary part of writing code. Good resources include your
TAs, classmates, Google, and Stack Overflow. Remember, however, that
this isn't a race: you should make an effort to understand everything
deeply before moving on to the next step.

### Step 3: Refactor
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without
changing its behavior. Your first approach to a problem will never be
ideal; going back and refactoring your code is a good way to clean
things up, try new patterns, implement best practices, and become a
better programmer overall. Refactor as much as you have time for, and
strive to become a better coder than your past self. :)

### Step 4: Read the Solutions
Do this after completing the assignment (never before). Ideally you
should finish your own implementation and spend at least some time
refactoring before you look at the solutions. If you "peek ahead" at
the solutions, you are only hurting yourself. Assuming you're trying to
get a job after the program, employers will be concerned only with your
actual ability; they don't care whether you finished all of your
assignments or got good grades at a/A (and in fact, we don't give letter
grades). The concepts will stick much better if you master them through
personal effort.

### Step 5: Give Feedback
At the end of each day, you will be asked to give feedback on the
organization of the material and the effectiveness of instruction. Since
this part of the course is still in beta, we're still working to
fine-tune it. Please let us know what works well and what could be
improved!
