# Setting Up Your Programming Environment

Before you start to work on the prep course material, it is important
that you make sure that you have the tools to:
* Write and run Ruby code
* Communicate and collaborate with classmates and instructional staff

## Programming In the Cloud

You can get through the App Academy Prep work using only a web browser.
A lot of the hassle of configuration is taken care of automatically by
the tools we use, and programming in the cloud makes it easy for TAs
to review your code remotely.

The minimum requirements are:
* a modern web browser (we recommend [Google Chrome][chrome], but
  [Mozilla Firefox][firefox] is also acceptable).
* an active [Github][github] account.
* an active [Cloud9][cloud9] account, linked with your Github account.
* an active [Slack](#slack) account (don't set this up until we send you
  an invitation to the App Academy team). You can either download the
  Slack client or simply use their browser app.

[firefox]: http://www.mozilla.org/firefox-download/
[github]: https://github.com/
[cloud9]: ./cloud9/

### Slack

Slack is a chat client similar to IRC. It supports public and private
channels, direct messages, formatted code blocks, and more. Slack is
our go-to app for team communication, and it will be your best bet for
chatting with classmates and getting assistance from TAs. You should
either install the desktop client, or bookmark the web version. You can
type `code snippets` by surrounding text in \`backticks\`. You can also
open and close multi-line code blocks like this:

    ```
    # your code goes here
    ```
