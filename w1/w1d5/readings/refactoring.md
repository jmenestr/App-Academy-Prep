# Refactoring (code smells)

From the [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell):

> A code smell is any symptom in the source code of a program that
> possibly indicates a deeper problem. Code smells are usually not
> bugs â€” they are not technically incorrect and don't currently
> prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate
> weaknesses in design that may be slowing down development or
> increasing the risk of bugs or failures in the future ... a code
> smell is a driver for refactoring.

We list a few kinds of smells here here:

**Duplicated/similar code**: see the [reading][dry-reading] on DRY code.

**Long methods**: see the [reading][method-decomp-reading] on method
decomposition.

**Too many parameters**: The more parameters a method has, the greater
the chance that it is too coupled to code that invokes it. Many
parameters may also be a sign of an excessively complex method.

**Data clump**: if you see a group of data always being passed around
together, this is usually a good candidate for refactoring out into an
object. For example `start_date` and `end_date` might be pulled out
into a `date_range` object.

**Long method chains**: long method chains can often be a sign that
you're violating the [Law of Demeter][wiki-demeter]: only talk to your
"neighbors", only use one dot.

```ruby
bicycle.front_tire.rotate
bicycle.rear_tire.rotate

# vs
bicycle.rotate_tires
```

The idea is that instead of reaching into objects (like the `bicycle`)
and calling methods on their "internals" (`front_tire` and
`rear_tire`), we should create a method that will take care of this
for us (`rotate_tires`). This helps us organize our code, and prevents
us from becoming too dependent on the internal structure of other
objects.

LoD has disadvantages (see the wiki article); if taken too literally
you end up with overly wide interfaces. However, the longer your
method chains get, the more likely you should apply LoD.

**Indecent Exposure**: Classes should share the bare minimum interface
with the outside world. If you don't have a compelling reason to make
a method or variable public, hide it. Other classes will interact with
the public surface of the class; any change to the public surface will
necessitate changes to interacting classes. Minimizing exposure will
better enable change.

[From the wiki page:][coupling-wiki] "Coupling (dependency) is the
degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other
modules."

Indecent exposure may result in coupling that is too tight. The more
extensive your classes' interface, the more tightly other classes can
latch on to it.

A complicated interface can also signal a class that is doing too
much. Probably there's an opportunity to break out responsibilities to
other classes.

We want to minimize the amount of coupling between our classes and
objects. To understand how tightly coupled your classes are, ask
yourself if you changed the internals of one class, would you have to
change things in the other? If you do, you've likely coupled the two
classes too tightly.

**Speculative Generality**: Follow the principle of
[YAGNI][wiki-yagni] ('You ain't gonna need it'). New devs often waste
time thinking of all the ways they might "generalize" their code so
that it's easy to make this change or that change, so that they can
support all sorts of new features easily, etc., etc. This can result
in a very complicated design, before any business need for those
features even exists.

More importantly, it is very, very hard to get a speculative design
like this right. Good design happens when there are clear requirements
and concrete examples to think about; it's hard to make a perfect
design for some hazy, poorly understood future. Don't solve *abstract*
problems: wait until you have a *concrete* problem.

[wiki-yagni]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it

**God object**: A god object is one that is very tightly connected to
all the other objects in the system. Good OO design results in classes
that are lightly coupled. A good class delegates responsibility as
necessary to other objects; it shouldn't need to know everything about
what every other object is doing (omniscience), and it shouldn't
micromanage how other objects manage their responsibilities. Nothing
in your program usually needs to even know about the existence of
everything else.

**Dead code**: don't leave commented-out (or otherwise unused) code in
your code base. This is why we have version control (we'll learn about
git soon!). Clean up after yourself!

## Clean Code

When push comes to shove, sometimes you need to make compromises; when
deadlines hit, we all ship code we aren't 100% proud of. Still,
endeavor to write clean code. Pay attention to style. Pay attention to
code organization. Pay attention to code smells. Refactor often and
aggressively. Bask in the beauty of clean code. Take pride in it.
